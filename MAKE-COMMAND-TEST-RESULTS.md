kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 -n monitoring      # admin/admin123
kubectl port-forward svc/alertmanager 9093:9093 -n monitoring

# Data Platform
kubectl port-forward svc/nifi 8080:8080 -n data-engineering           # admin/nifi123456789!
kubectl port-forward svc/trino 8080:8080 -n data-engineering
kubectl port-forward svc/minio-console 9001:9001 -n data-engineering  # admin/minio123!
