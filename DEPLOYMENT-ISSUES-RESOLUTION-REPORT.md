# Deployment Issues Resolution Report

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the JSON deployment readiness report and PowerShell script logs, I have identified and resolved the following critical issues affecting the K3s home lab deployment:

1. **Terraform Validation Errors** - Unsupported arguments in backup module
2. **Hardcoded Secrets** - Security vulnerabilities in configuration files
3. **APT Process Lock Issues** - Deployment failures on worker nodes
4. **Missing Module Dependencies** - Incomplete backup module configuration

## Detailed Issue Analysis and Resolutions

### 1. Terraform Backup Module Validation Errors

**Issue**: The backup module in `terraform/environments/prod/main.tf` line 149-152 contains unsupported arguments:
- `cluster_name`
- `environment`
- `backup_schedule`
- `backup_retention`

**Root Cause**: The backup module's `variables.tf` file is missing, causing Terraform to reject these arguments.

**Resolution**: Created the missing backup module variables file and fixed the module configuration.

### 2. Hardcoded Secrets Security Issue

**Issue**: Found hardcoded passwords in multiple files:
- `scripts/setup/prepare-pis.ps1`: Default password "hezekiah"
- `terraform/environments/dev/variables.tf`: "admin123" and "dev-admin-password-123"
- Various `.tfvars.example` files contain placeholder passwords

**Resolution**: Implemented secure secrets management strategy using environment variables and generated passwords.

### 3. APT Process Lock Issues on Worker Nodes

**Issue**: Puppet deployment failures on `pi-worker-1` and `pi-worker-2` due to conflicting apt processes.

**Resolution**: Enhanced the existing `fix-apt-locks.ps1` script and integrated it into the deployment pipeline.

### 4. Inventory YAML Configuration

**Issue**: While the current `inventory.yaml` file is syntactically valid, it needs optimization for better error handling and security.

**Resolution**: Enhanced inventory configuration with improved error handling and security settings.
